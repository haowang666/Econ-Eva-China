## Question
Explain political trust and demand for democracy in China with a national survey. 

## Paths
Two different approaches driven from modernization theory:

1. Economic growth --> income inequality --> trust in Gov./demand for democracy
2. Economic growth --> critical thinking ability --> trust in Gov./demand for democracy

## Analysis
Data: Data in this study comes from two sources: provincial level economic growth data is collected from China Compendium of Statistics (1950-2009), Individual level data is from the 2006 China General Social Survey (CGSS). CGSS is a annual/biannual survey of China's urban and rural households and it started at 2003. In 2006, the survey was conducted between September and November, 10151 households in 28 provinces (out of 31) were interviewed. Response rate in the 2006 survey was about 51.10% and the missing value rate was about 3.41%.

## Method
